\title{Stacks a Matrix using matrix operator "vec"}
\usage{
vec(A, use.Names = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{A matrix with m rows and n columns.}

\item{use.Names}{Logical. If TRUE, the names of A are taken to be names of the stacked matrix. Default: TRUE.}
}
\value{
A vector with mn elements.
}
\description{
Returns a column vector that stacks the columns of \emph{A}, a m x n matrix.
}
\note{
\enumerate{
\item Unlike other `vec()` functions on CRAN, matrixNormal versions inherit names from matrices to their vectorized forms.
\item vec() was adapted from Frederick Novomestky's \pkg{matrixcalc}. This function is edited so that it can take dimension names and return the matrix as a vector.
\item These functions were used as accessories used in matrixNormal functions.
}
}
\examples{
M <- matrix(c(4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), nrow = 3)
M
# Compare vec from \pkg{matrixcalc} and new function.
matrixcalc::vec(M)
vec(M)
# The names are rownames(M):colnames(M) in that order.
# Very similar to matrixcalc but dimension names are different.
